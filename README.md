# MMIW AR Face Mesh App

## Project
Our goal is to bring awareness to MMIW through the use of augmented reality face meshing technology. Users will learn about MMIW and then be able to take a picture with the iconic red hand over their face. They will then be able to share that picture with whatever social media or device they choose.

 ## Things to know
 This is a mono-repo, so check each folder's readme to learn about each piece.

 ### iOS
 We will write the iOS portion using Swift and Google's ARCore. We will use the
 repo's Projects section to manage tickets.

 [iOS Readme](iOS/README.md)

 ### Android
 We will write the Android portion using Kotlin and Google's ARCore.

 ### Web/Database/Backend

 TBD - There's an idea to have each user share their photos to a central location
 and we can have a large collage. A bit of a stretch goal at the moment.
